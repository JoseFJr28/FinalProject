# Concentration 64
Concentration 64 is a fast-paced clapping game that is often played by children 
in the playground. However, the structure means that it can also be adapted for 
use as a learning activity or to spark discussion. As well as being known as 
Concentration 64, it can also be sung as Concentration 54. The rhyme is simple 
and sets out the rules of the game which is for each player to be able to name 
items in the chosen category with no repetition or hesitation. If the players 
are too slow in naming an item in the category that hasnâ€™t been saying before, 
they lose! Once someone has lost, you simply choose a new person to recite the 
rhyme and choose a brand-new category. We also feature a Memory Training mode 
that provides a way to see how good you really are at memorizing words.
